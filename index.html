                        <p>For my midterm exam assignment in the Human-Computer Interaction course, which has a one-week deadline, 
                            I created a prototype design using Figma for an application called Calm, focusing on mental health. 
                            In this project, I developed several page, including the splash screen, login, sign-up, profile, homepage, 
                            service selection, consultation, payment, chat with a professionals, and consultation history. 
                            Through this project, I gained a better understanding of how to effectively use Figma and its tools.

                        <p>This project involved creating a prototype for the WatcHGoods website using Figma, 
                            followed by implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. WatcHGoods is an online platform specializing in the sale of 
                            pre-owned luxury watches, all of which have been authenticated by experts to ensure their authenticity. 
                            Throughout this project, I developed the homepage, product page, about us section, and contact us page, enhancing my skills in UI/UX design and web development. </p>

                        <p>In our team project for the Software Engineering course, we developed an application called E-court, 
                          a web-based platform designed to assist users in finding service providers or technicians in the electronics field. 
                          In this project, I was responsible for designing prototypes, including the homepage, a page explaining how our website works, and the about us page. Additionally, I contributed to the front-end development for the Consultation page.

                        <p>This project is the final assignment for the Pattern Software Design course and is a group task. 
                            GymMe is a web-based application that sells health supplements. The development of this application utilizes 
                            ASP.NET and applies the Domain Driven Design method. In this project, I worked on the Login and Register pages, 
                            which required validation and cookie management.
